# Running the program

After compiling, the program can be launched using *java RunProgram*.<br>
Upon running the program, you will be prompted for input. Follow the instructions on screen to select the furniture item you wish to order, then which type, and the quantity you would like.<br>
Afterwards, the program will find the cheapest combination of used items to purchase in order to fulfill your order, and will generate an order form for you.<br>
Once the order is completed, the program will ask whether you wish to quit or make another order.<br>
